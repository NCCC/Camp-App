## Bugfixes
  * [ ] iOS crash? Sometimes just shows white screen when starting up.
  * [x] Scroll to top when changing sections
  * [ ] iOS home screen app cannot be force refreshed?
  * [x] Information section arrows should rotate like in the Schedule section

## Todo
  * [x] iOS: Hide the address bar when added to home screen
  * [ ] Password function to protect sensitive information like group members/participant information
  * [ ] "Last updated" timestamp
  * [ ] Instead of hard coding each camp in PHP, maybe actually use a Google Sheets for adding and renaming camps too?
  * [ ] Make a better "front page" instead of just "Select a camp", can use the same Sheets above to update information.
  * [ ] Make the "Select a camp" menu nested, so we can have Summer Camp as a group with all the different camps as sub-items, f.ex.
  * [ ] Detect links and e-mails in Information. Or use Markup? But could be too complicated for users. Alternatively: Combine Information and Contact Section so we can use the same columns for Phone, Link, Email.
  * [ ] Add contact details for submitting bug reports

### Wishlist (Less important todos)
  * [ ] Add images to Information or other sections, not just Map
  * [ ] Add a Bible verse in the loading screen?
  * [x] Select colors for icons in Information
  * [ ] Select colors for icons in Map and Contact, or just make them black
  * [ ] Graphical schedule
  * [ ] Show multiple camp schedules side by side
  * [ ] Instead of making separate Google Sheets for Chinese and English version of the same camp, make it possible to use the same Sheet but have one column for English and one for Chinese
  * [ ] Let users turn on push notifications for specific/all events
  * [ ] Push/alert functionality to send messages to people who has enabled this for the specific camp (must not send messages to previous camp participants if the message is for a different camp in the future)
